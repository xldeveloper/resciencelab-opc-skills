# RequestHunt Skill

Generate user demand research reports by collecting and analyzing real user feedback from Reddit, X (Twitter), and GitHub.

## Prerequisites

Set API key in `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
export REQUESTHUNT_API_KEY="your_api_key"
```

Get your key from: https://requesthunt.com/settings/api

**Quick Check**:
```bash
cd <skill_directory>
python3 scripts/get_usage.py
```

## Research Workflow

This skill helps you generate comprehensive user demand research reports. Follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Define Scope

Before collecting data, clarify with the user:
1. **Research Goal**: What domain/area to investigate? (e.g., AI coding assistants, project management tools)
2. **Specific Products**: Any products/competitors to focus on? (e.g., Cursor, GitHub Copilot)
3. **Platform Preference**: Which platforms to prioritize? (reddit, x, github)
4. **Time Range**: How recent should the feedback be?
5. **Report Purpose**: Product planning / competitive analysis / market research?

### Step 2: Collect Data

```bash
# 1. Trigger realtime scrape for the topic
python3 scripts/scrape_topic.py "ai-coding-assistant" --platforms reddit,x,github

# 2. Search with expansion for more data
python3 scripts/search_requests.py "code completion" --expand --limit 50

# 3. List requests filtered by topic
python3 scripts/list_requests.py --topic "ai-tools" --limit 100
```

### Step 3: Generate Report

Analyze collected data and generate a structured Markdown report:

```markdown
# [Topic] User Demand Research Report

## Overview
- Scope: ...
- Data Sources: Reddit (X), X (Y), GitHub (Z)
- Time Range: ...

## Key Findings

### 1. Top Feature Requests

### 4. Opportunities
- ...

## Methodology
Based on N real user feedbacks collected via RequestHunt...
