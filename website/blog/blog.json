        {
          "question": "Is it really possible to build production MVPs with $0 API costs?",
          "answer": "Yes. Jan v3-4B handles 70-80% of MVP development tasks. For the remaining 20%, you can iterate with Jan (slower but free) or pay $20-50 for Claude API. Average MVP: 80% Jan, 20% Claude = $20-50 total cost instead of $200+."
        },
        {
          "question": "What hardware do I need to run Jan locally?",
          "answer": "Minimum: 16GB RAM, 40GB storage, any M1+ Mac or recent gaming laptop. Recommended: 32GB+ RAM, SSD. Jan runs ~30 tokens/sec on M3, ~40 tokens/sec on RTX 4070. Slower than Claude API but free and unlimited scaling."
        },
        {
          "question": "How does Jan v3-4B compare to Claude for coding?",
          "answer": "Jan handles CRUD, boilerplate, bug fixes, and simple features at 70-85% of Claude's quality. For complex architecture or security-critical code, use Claude. The hybrid approach: use Jan for 70% of features, Claude for critical 20%, iterate with Jan for 10%."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is DeepSeek and why is it free?",
          "answer": "DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer, a quantitative hedge fund with 140-200 people. They release world-class open-source models for free. DeepSeek OCR-2 handles document processing 97% accurately, compared to Claude Vision at 95% for $0.03/image."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I use Jan + DeepSeek for production services?",
          "answer": "Yes. Both are open-source with no licensing restrictions. You can build and sell products using them. No API rate limits. The only cost is your hardware."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does setup take?",
          "answer": "Install Jan (10 min), download v3-4B model (10 min), install OPC Skills (2 min) = 22 minutes total. First MVP ready to build immediately after."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if Jan fails on a complex feature?",
          "answer": "Options: (1) Iterate with Jan (free, slow), (2) Use Claude API for that feature only ($0.24-1), (3) Simplify the feature to match Jan's capabilities. Most solopreneurs choose (1) or (2)."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is this approach better than using Llama or other free models?",
          "answer": "Llama 70B is higher quality but needs 140GB VRAM (most people don't have). Jan v3-4B is optimized for consumer hardware. Llama better if you have GPU; Jan better for local development on laptops."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I integrate OPC Skills with Jan?",
          "answer": "Install OPC Skills globally (npx skills add ReScienceLab/opc-skills), then use them in Claude Code or Cursor with Jan as your model. OPC Skills work with any compatible AI tool + local inference."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the breakeven point: local infrastructure vs Claude API costs?",
          "answer": "If you buy a gaming laptop ($1500) for local development vs Claude API ($200/month), you break even in 7.5 months. After that, all development is free forever. For existing Mac users: breakeven is month 1 (already own hardware)."

Each iteration spawns a fresh AI instance that picks the highest priority incomplete task, implements it, runs tests, and commits. Memory persists via git history, progress.txt, and prd.json."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can solopreneurs build MVPs with Ralph without coding experience?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How long does Ralph take to build an MVP?",
          "answer": "Based on our case study, Ralph built a complete SaaS dashboard with authentication in 24 hours (15 user stories, 47 commits, 28 passing tests). Typical MVPs take 24-72 hours of autonomous development."

        {
          "question": "Which AI coding tools does Ralph support?",

        },
        {
          "question": "How does Ralph integrate with OPC Skills?",
          "answer": "Install OPC skills globally (npx skills add ReScienceLab/opc-skills) and Ralph's AI instances automatically have access during the loop. Your PRD can reference skills like domain-hunter or logo-creator, and Ralph invokes them as needed."

          "question": "What is prd.json and how do I create it?",
          "answer": "prd.json is a JSON file containing user stories with pass/fail status. Create it using the ralph skill: (1) Write PRD in markdown, (2) Run 'Load ralph skill and convert prd.md to prd.json'."

        {
          "question": "Does Ralph work for frontend/UI development?",

          "question": "How much does it cost to run Ralph?",
          "answer": "Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5): $30-60 for typical MVP. Amp pricing varies. Ralph is often cheaper than manual coding because fresh context reduces retries and errors."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is Ralph production-ready for startups?",
          "answer": "Yes, with caveats. Ralph requires strong feedback loops (tests, type checking) and well-structured PRDs. Best for solopreneurs who can review code before deployment. 7.9k GitHub stars indicate active community usage."
        },
        {
          "question": "What are the prerequisites to run Ralph?",
